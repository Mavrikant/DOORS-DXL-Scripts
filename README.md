## How to install

Its copies the full path of the current module into the clipboard.

### Copy Object ID (Ctrl + 3)

It copies Id of the selected object(s) into the clipboard. If multiple objects are selected they are will be separated by a newline.

### Copy Object ID (Ctrl + 3)

This script shows baseline comparison windows similar to DOORS's windows with an extra button for Beyond Compare. It creates a .txt export of selected baselines in the background and then compares them with Beyond Compare. It's easier to see the difference with this method.  
 
**TODO:** Add a button for WinMerge too.
