A collection of useful DOORS DXL scripts that are independent of any specific project.

## How to install

- Download all files inside of this repo.
- Copy all files into your Doors installation folder ```C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.5\lib\dxl\addins\user```

## Scripts

### Copy Baseline number (Ctrl + 1)

Its copies the last baseline number ```Doors baseline X.X``` into the clipboard.

### Copy Module Path (Ctrl + 2)

It copies the full path of the current module to the clipboard.

### Copy Object ID (Ctrl + 3)

It copies Id of the selected object(s) into the clipboard. If multiple objects are selected they are will be separated by a newline.

### Enhanced Baseline Comparison (Ctrl + 3)

This script shows baseline comparison windows similar to DOORS's windows with an extra button for Beyond Compare. It creates a .txt export of selected baselines in the background and then compares them with Beyond Compare. It's easier to see the difference with this method.

It copies the links from the source object to the destination object.

### Export all modules into HTML

These scripts recursively export all items under the project to a folder as a fancy-styled useful HTML report.

The following batch command can be used with **Task Scheduler** to periodically export modules.

```"C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.5\bin\doors.exe" -u "USERNAME" -P "PASSWORD" -p "PROJECT_NAME" -b "addins\user\ExportAllModulesIntoHTML.dxl" -W```

HTML reports can be served using Python's simple HTTP server command: ```python -m http.server 1111```.
